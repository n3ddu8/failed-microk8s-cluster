# PiCluster

This project was inteded to be a fun way to learn some new skills. I chose micro-k8s because of it's seamless integration with micro ceph but unfortantly it turned out not to be suitable for my application, without some serious configuration. I've therefor archived the project while I work on a new K3S cluster, I will delete this repo in due course but am keeping it around for now to reference.
